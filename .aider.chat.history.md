A sleek digital clock face with large numerals counting down from 10 to 0, surrounded by stylized representations of popular cryptocurrency tokens—a green gradient coin, a blue coin with a stylized letter, and a gold coin with a star. The background is a subtle gradient from dark blue to black, giving a modern tech feel. The clock face is centered with a subtle glow around the numerals, conveying urgency and technology.
